# VIAL support for Keychron K8 Pro
This allows you to port your K8 Pro to VIAL

Only ANSI RGB so far, if you need another model, feel free to open an issue.

- run `git make-submodule` after pulling for the first time
- Compile with `make keychron/k8_pro/ansi/rgb:vial -j`


- If this doesn't work, you might have to repeat step 5 on the porting documentation: https://get.vial.today/docs/porting-to-vial.html
- If it still doesn't compile, you might wanna try and go through the whole porting guide again: https://get.vial.today/docs/porting-to-vial.html
